# File Compression Utility

A Python-based file compression and decompression tool using **Huffman Coding**. This utility allows users to compress files into a binary format and decompress them back to their original form. It features a user-friendly GUI built with `customtkinter` for easy interaction.

---

## Features

- **File Compression:** Compresses files using Huffman Coding, reducing file size while maintaining data integrity.
- **File Decompression:** Restores compressed files to their original state using metadata stored during compression.
- **Cross-Platform GUI:** Built with `customtkinter`, providing a modern and intuitive interface for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Efficient Encoding:** Uses Huffman Coding to generate optimal prefix codes for efficient compression.
- **Metadata Storage:** Saves Huffman codes and file extension in a metadata file for accurate decompression.

## How It Works

### Compression Process
1. **Frequency Calculation:** The utility reads the input file and calculates the frequency of each byte.
2. **Huffman Tree Construction:** A Huffman tree is built using a priority queue (min-heap) based on byte frequencies.
3. **Code Generation:** Huffman codes are generated by traversing the tree, assigning shorter codes to more frequent bytes.
4. **Encoding:** The file is encoded using the generated Huffman codes.
5. **Output:** The compressed data is saved as a `.bin` file, and the Huffman codes are stored in a metadata file.

### Decompression Process
1. **Metadata Retrieval:** The Huffman codes and original file extension are loaded from the metadata file.
2. **Decoding:** The compressed binary data is decoded using the Huffman codes.
3. **Output:** The decompressed data is saved as a new file with the original extension.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `customtkinter`, `heapq`, `os`, `pickle`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-compression-utility.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd file-compression-utility
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Compress a File:**
   - Click the **"Compress File"** button.
   - Select the file you want to compress.
   - The compressed `.bin` file and metadata file will be saved in the same directory.

3. **Decompress a File:**
   - Click the **"Decompress File"** button.
   - Select the `.bin` file you want to decompress.
   - The decompressed file will be saved with its original extension.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **`heapq`:** Used to build and manage the Huffman tree.
- **`pickle`:** Used to serialize and save Huffman codes in the metadata file.
- **`customtkinter`:** Provides the modern GUI for the application.
- **`os`:** Handles file paths and extensions.

### File Structure
- **`main.py`:** The main script containing the compression, decompression, and GUI logic.
- **`README.md`:** This documentation file.
- **`screenshots/`:** Directory containing screenshots of the application.

## Limitations
- **File Size:** The utility is optimized for small to medium-sized files. Large files may take longer to process.
- **Binary Files:** While the tool supports binary files, extremely large binary files may not compress significantly due to their inherent entropy.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Parallel Processing:** Implement multi-threading to speed up compression and decompression for large files.
- **Support for More Algorithms:** Add support for other compression algorithms like LZ77 or DEFLATE.
- **Cloud Integration:** Allow users to compress and decompress files directly from cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
